    <h1>Terms of Service for BetBros</h1>
    <p>Last updated: May 10, 2023</p>
    <p>Welcome to BetBros, where we bring the excitement of gambling to your fingertips without any real money involved. Our mission is to provide a fun and engaging platform for you and your friends to enjoy without the risk of losing your life savings. But remember, we're not responsible if you become an addict because of this.</p>
    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully, as they govern your use of our web-based gambling application ("Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use our Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into these Terms. If you're not old enough, we'll have to ask you to kindly step away from the table.</p>
    <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
    <p>To use our Service, you must create an account by providing a valid email address. You are responsible for the security of your account, and we are not liable for any loss or damage that may result from unauthorized access to or use of your account. If you suspect that your account has been compromised, please contact us immediately. And don't worry, we won't be sending you any spam or sharing your email with third parties.</p>
    <h2>3. Privacy</h2>
    <p>We value your privacy and only collect your email address for account creation purposes. We use cookies to track login information to keep your account secure. You can find more information about how we handle your data in our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h2>4. No Real Money</h2>
    <p>We want to make it crystal clear that our Service does not involve real money gambling. All bets and winnings on our platform are in the form of virtual currency, which has no real-world value. Please don't try to buy a yacht with your BetBros winnings.</p>
    <h2>5. Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree to use our Service in a responsible and respectful manner. Any abusive, offensive, or illegal behavior is strictly prohibited. If we find you breaking these rules, we reserve the right to terminate your account and ban you from our platform. This is including, but not limited to account termination and IP based banning.</p>
    <h2>6. Changes to the Service</h2>
    <p>We may update, modify, or discontinue the Service at any time without notice. We're not responsible for any harm or loss you may experience due to changes in the Service.</p>
    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to our Service without prior notice if you breach these Terms or if we suspect any fraudulent or harmful activity. If you're not playing nice, we'll have to ask you to leave the virtual casino.</p>
    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of The State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In the event of any dispute, the courts of The State of Texas shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we'll post the updated Terms on our website. Your continued use of the Service after the changes are posted will be deemed as your acceptance of those changes.</p>
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms or our Service, please don't hesitate to contact us at support@betbros.com. We're always here to help and make sure you have the best experience possible on our platform.</p>
    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and BetBros regarding your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and BetBros. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.</p>
    <h2>Waiver and Severability</h2>
    <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and BetBros' failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall BetBros, its affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.</p>
