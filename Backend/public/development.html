        <h2>Alpha 1.0 May 18, 2023</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the first test of the BetBros app. We currently have functionality to do everything it looks like you can do. The mobile experience is a tad lacking at the minute, but it is workable
          I suggest going landscape to place your picks and avoid the homefeed if you are on mobile. Along with that, please for the love of god don't lose your password atm. I will have a reset function.
          I have fixed commenting on the home page. Try it out. That being said, you will have to reload to post a new comment. Fix coming soon TM for that. Right now odds update every 30 mins and results go every 4 hours. 
          This will change but the api costs money =(. Thanks, you guys know how to find me if something breaks.
        </p>
